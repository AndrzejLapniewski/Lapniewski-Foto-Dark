## Technologies

HTML5 and CSS3 were used.
I learned and practiced the hover and flex functions,
In a later phase, I will introduce interaction in JS.


## Status
The website works, but it needs to be refined: 
- save pictures in the gallery (hover). 
- add a navigation menu at the bottom of the page (next gallery, previous gallery, home page). 

No JS code has been used yet.
